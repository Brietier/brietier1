      <p>Archeologists have uncovered human-made ceramics that date back to at least
        24,000 BC. These ceramics were found in Czechoslovakia and were in the form of
        animal and human figurines, slabs, and balls. These ceramics were made of animal
        fat and bone mixed with bone ash and a fine claylike material. After forming, the
        ceramics were fired at temperatures between 500-800°C in domed and horseshoe shaped
        kilns partially dug into the ground with loess walls. While it is not clear what these
        ceramics were used for, it is not thought to have been a utilitarian one. The first
        use of functional pottery vessels is thought to be in 9,000 BC. These vessels were
        most likely used to hold and store grain and other foods.

    <br>
    <br>
        It is thought that ancient glass manufacture is closely related to pottery making, which
        flourished in Upper Egypt about 8,000 BC. While firing pottery, the presence of calcium
        oxide (CaO) containing sand combined with soda and the overheating of the pottery kiln
        may have resulted in a colored glaze on the ceramic pot. Experts believe that it was not
        until 1,500 BC that glass was produced independently of ceramics and fashioned into separate
        items.
      </p>
      <p >Since these ancient times, the technology and applications of ceramics (including glass) has
      steadily increased. We often take for granted the major role that ceramics have played in the
      progress of humankind. Below are just a few examples of how important ceramics are to society.

          <h3>Clay</h3>
          <p>The three most commonly used clay bodies are earthenware clay bodies, mid-fire stoneware clay
          bodies, and high-fire stoneware clay bodies. All three are available commercially in moist,
          ready-to-use form. Clay bodies can also be produced by mixing dry clays and additives with
          water to create your own desired clay body.
          </P>
          <h3>Chamois</h3>
          <p>Chamois skin is great for compressing the edges of your pottery. The skin can also be used
          to smooth any pottery ware that has a rough feel.
          </P>
          <h3>Towels</h3>
          <p>Towels are a necessity in pottery. When you are throwing, it is ideal to wipe your hands
          occasionally as well as placing the towel on your lap to avoid ruining your clothes.
          </P>
          <h3>Potters Needles</h3>
          <p>Potters needles are very long and a little on the heavy side. They are used to trim the top
          of your pottery ware while it is on the wheel. The needles are also used for scoring slabs
          of clay.
          </P>
          <h3>Cut-off Wires</h3>
          <p>Cut-off wires have a wooden handle on each end and is used to cut large clumps of clay.
          The wire also helps to remove any excess clay that remains on the wheel.
          </P>
          <h3>Scrappers and Ribs</h3>
          <p>These two tools are excellent for smoothing pottery ware and shaping them while they are
          on the wheel.
          </P>
          <h3>Fettling Knives</h3>
          <p>This particular style of knife is used to cut slabs of clay or to remove the fettle of your
          pottery ware. The fettle is the small ridge of material that is left where the pieces of the
          mold join together.
          </P>
          <h3>Ribbon Tools</h3>
          <p>Ribbon tools are great from trimming any green-ware and to help in hand-building your pottery.
          Although these tools work great for trimming, they are to fragile to be used during the throwing
          process.
          </P>

        <h3>Wooden Modeling Tools</h3>
        <p>These particular tools are also ideal for any hand-building projects. They also work great for
        any trimming that needs to be done.
        </P>
        <h3>Calipers</h3>
        <p>Calipers are used to measure the inner and outer dimensions of pottery ware. This comes in handy
        for projects such as jars and saucers.
        </P>
        <h3>Box</h3>
        <p>Having a box to carry all of your pottery tools is ideal for anyone that is taking pottery classes
        or teaching classes is different areas.  It's worth including some accessories such as transfers for
        ceramics or ceramic decals which will improve the decorative value of your projects.

      <h3>Handbuilding</h3>
      <p>The relationship between hands and clay is the basis of the ceramic art form. When you put your hands
          to clay, the natural inclination to form, shape, and ultimately create something from the fine-grained
          soil is inescapable. Handbuilt objects can be produced by pinching balls of clay, joining slabs, or
          creating coils.
      </p>
      <h3>Pinching</h3>
      <p>Shape a piece of clay into a smooth ball about the size of your hand. As you hold the clay sphere, press
        your thumb into the center of the ball, about halfway down to the bottom. As you revolve the ball with one
        hand, press the walls out evenly with your thumb on the inside and your fingers on the outside. Smooth the
        surface with a damp sponge.
      </p>
      <h3>Slab Construction</h3>
      <p>Begin with rolled-out, flat, and wet or moist pieces of clay (you can roll them out by hand-tossing or using
        a rolling pin or slab roller). Soft slab naturally warps and bends during the making and firing, so roll out
        the slabs on each side repeatedly. Stack with a smooth and wrinkle-free material in between each slab to prevent
        any tearing or distortion. Then cut each individual piece into shapes, and connect or form them into an object.
        Score and slip the joined areas to ensure the object will dry out without losing its form.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <h3>Coil Construction</h3>
        <p>Use your fingers to roll out soft clay into long, thick strips about ¼ – ½ inches wide (think: long, thick pasta
          noodles), and smooth out a plate of clay. This will be the base on which the coils will be stacked. After layering
          the coils one on top of the other, ensure that they are joined securely by scoring and slipping them together.
        </p>
      <h3>Wheel Throwing/Hand Throwing</h3>
        <p>Drop a kneaded ball of clay with some force onto the center of the wheel head. With a bowl of water, wet hands and
          clay as the wheel spins quickly. Cup clay in your hands and use your legs and core to keep your body steady and to
          provide extra strength in order to bring it into a tower shape. Pushing the clay down and in simultaneously with the
          palms of your hands, let extra clay and water disperse from the shape being formed. Keep the clay centered for an even
          rotation and appearance. Use one hand to find the center of the ball and open it with your fingers as the other hand
          holds it intact. Once the bottom is compressed, the walls are raised, thinned, and shaped as much as you like, and the
          top is evened out, let finish and dry.

      <h3>Bisque Firing</h3>
        <p>Bisque firing refers to the first time newly shaped clay pots, or greenware, go through high-temperature heating. It is
          done to vitrify, which means, "to turn it glasslike," to a point that the pottery can have a glaze adhere to the surface.
    <br>
    <br>
          Greenware is fragile. To start, it must be bone-dry. Then, it must be loaded into the kiln with a great deal of care. The
          kiln is closed and heating slowly begins.
    <br>
    <br>
          Slow temperature rise is critical. During the beginning of the bisque firing, the last of the atmospheric water is driven
          out of the clay. If it is heated too quickly, the water turns into steam while inside the clay body, which can cause the
          clay to burst.
        </p>
      <h3>Glaze Firing</h3>
          <p>  Potters apply a layer of glaze to the bisqueware, leave it to dry, then load it in the kiln for its final step, glaze firing.
            <br>

            The glazed item is carefully loaded into the kiln for the glaze firing. It must not touch other pots or the glazes will melt together,
            fusing the pots permanently. The kiln is heated slowly to the proper temperature to bring the clay and glazes to maturity, then it
            is slowly cooled again. The kiln is opened and unloaded after it has cooled completely.
          </p>
          <p>This second kiln firing causes a remarkable change in the clay and glaze. It completes the transformation of pots from a soft, fragile
          substance to one that is rock-hard and impervious to water and time.
